📚 About the Project
This project is part of my data analytics portfolio and focuses on analyzing Airbnb data using SQL. It was developed as part of the course "Foundations of SQL: Learning the Language of Data" by Data Tutor, under the guidance of Alexandra Athanasakou.

📁 Contents
sql/: Contains the SQL script used to create the database, tables, and all SQL queries.
presentation/: Includes the PowerPoint technical presentation with the analysis results.

🛠️ How to Use
Explore the Database
Open the SQL file (create_database.sql) to study the database structure and understand how the tables are built.
Due to the large size of the dataset, the data files are not included in the repository.
Run SQL Queries
SQL commands used for data analysis and answering business questions are included in the sql_queries.sql file.
